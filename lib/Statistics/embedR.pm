=head1 NAME

Statistics::embedR - Object-oriented interface for Statistics::useR.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.1.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::embedR;

    my $r = Statistics::embedR->new(); # new() must be called at least once, before call the other method
    $r->eval($stat);                   # execute one statement
    $r->eval($stat1, $stat2);          # execute a list of statements sequentially

    $r->R("1");                        # 1
    $r->R("'1'");                      # '1'
    $r->R("a <- 1:3", "a");            # [1, 2, 3]

    my $ary = [3,5,7];
    $r->arry2R($ary, "array");         # array == c(3,5,7)

    $r->sum("c(2,3)");                 # 5, almost all R functions are available automatically
    $r->as_numeric('c("1", "2")');     # [1, 2], calls as.numeric(c("1", "2")) in the R end

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an object-oriented interface for Statistics::useR.
And provides some additional useful methods for invoking R.

Almost all R functions are automatically available for you. If the R functions have dots in the name,
you can call it with underscore from Perl instead, since Perl don't let you define a method with the
name containing dots.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

This method creates a Statistics::embedR instance. But you can call it as many times as you
want, since it'll only keep one copy of the instance during the life time of the whole program. And you have
to call it at least once before you can call the other methods provided by this module.

=item eval LIST

This method executes a list of R statements sequentially given by LIST.

=item R LIST

This method executes a list of R statements given by LIST, and return the value of the last statement in a
somewhat usefull way by some transformation, so that vector with the length 1 returns as a scalar, a vecotr
with the length other than 1 returns as a ARRAY reference, and other things returns as a HASH reference.

=item arry2R SRC DEST

This method convert a ARRAY ref given by SRC to a R vector, whose name is given by DEST.
